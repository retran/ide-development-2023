        <p><a href="https://retran.me/about/">Andrew Vasilyev</a>, also known as “retran”, embarked on his programming
          journey at a young age of five.
          Throughout his school years, he was deeply involved in competitive programming.</p>

        <p>He honed his skills in
          enterprise, e-commerce web development, and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) early in his career. His
          development tools experience began in 2013 at Acumatica, extending later to 1C Company, leading to his tenure
          at JetBrains from 2018, contributing to ReSharper and Rider.</p>

        <p>Between 2011 and 2014, he taught courses about
          “High-Level Language Programming” and “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning” at the Moscow Aviation
          Institute (MAI). He also shared his knowledge on “IDE Development” at the Higher School of Economics and
          mentored at Practicum by Yandex during 2021-2022.</p>
