				<h2>Project Model</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Understanding "Project"</h3>
				<p>
					A "project" is a detailed organizational structure that encompasses all the necessary files,
					configurations, settings, and resources required for developing a specific software application or
					solution. It functions as the primary unit for managing and organizing work within an IDE.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Components of a "Project"</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Source Code Files</b>: These are files written in programming languages like Java, C++, Python,
					etc. <br />
					<b>Resource Files</b>: These include images, configuration files, and data files, etc. <br />
					<b>Dependencies</b>: These are the libraries, modules, or packages that the project relies on.
					<br />
					<b>Build Configuration</b>: These are instructions on how to compile, run, and debug the software.
					<br />
					<b>Project Metadata</b>: This includes information about the project's settings, configurations, and
					structure, including compiler settings, debug configurations, and other environment-specific
					parameters. <br />
					<b>Database Configuration</b>: This includes connections, database scripts, and other related setups
					if the project interacts with databases. <br />
					<b>Documentation</b>: This includes comments, READMEs, or any other related documents. <br />
					<b>Version Control Information</b>: If the project is under version control (like Git, SVN), the IDE
					might store information about commits, branches, etc. <br />
				</p>

				<h3>Exploring Project Models</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>Project Models in IDEs represent the structure and organization of the projects,
							incorporating files, directories, dependencies, and configurations. They provide:</p>
						<p>- An API to describe and manage project elements<br />
							- Notifications about project changes<br />
							- Facets to provide configured views of projects, e.g., projects with different sets of
							referenced libraries depending on the target OS.</p>

				<h3>Types of Project Models</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p> A project model can be constructed using:<br />
							- Project Folder<br />
							- VCS<br />
							- Build Configuration<br />
							- Metadata</p>

				<h2>Virtual File Systems</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Understanding VFS</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>A Virtual File System (VFS) in an IDE acts as an abstraction layer that facilitates efficient
							interaction between the IDE and the underlying file system, offering a uniform interface to
							access files regardless of their location.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="https://maplehygienesolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Box-files.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>The Need for VFS</h3>
				<p>VFS is crucial for:</p>
				<p>- Providing a universal API for working with files, irrespective of their actual location (on disk,
					in an archive, on an HTTP server, etc.).</p>
				<p>- Detecting and tracking changes in files and enabling comparison between old and new versions.</p>
				<p>- Enhancing performance and user experience by minimizing and optimizing IO operations.</p>
				<p>- Allowing the addition of extra data attributes to a file.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Implementing VFS</h3>
				<p>1. Manage a persistent snapshot of files that have been requested through VFS.</p>
				<p>2. Execute all operations with files on VFS.</p>
				<p>3. Queue operations with actual files and execute them asynchronously on a single background thread,
					minimizing file lock duration.</p>
				<p>4. Track and queue external changes. Execute them on the snapshot when the IDE requires a "refresh".
				</p>
				<p>5. "Refresh" VFS on IDE startup, when switching from another application, etc.</p>
				<p>6. Notify subscribers about changes.</p>

				<h2>Program Structure Interface (PSI)</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What is PSI?</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>The Program Structure Interface (PSI) is a pivotal component in any JetBrains IDE. It enables
							the IDE to parse source code into a structured and navigable format, allowing developers to
							navigate, modify, and analyze the code efficiently.</p>
						<p>The PSI organizes code into trees and graphs, representing the hierarchical and structural
							relationships between various elements of the source code, from classes and methods to
							variables and expressions.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2023.2/ws_psi_viewer.png" width="700">
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Files and Modules</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>Semantic views of files and "file sets" can encapsulate other elements and provide different
							scopes of views from other modules.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="assets/lecture04/module.png" width="700">
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Abstract Syntax Tree</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>A data structure is used to represent the contents of a file, where each node in the tree
							denotes a construct in the source code.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="assets/lecture04/ast.png" width="700">
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Declared Element</h3>
				<p>A declared element is "something that has a declaration." This can be a class declaration, a method
					declaration, or something unrelated to code - such as HTML elements, CSS classes, colors, and file
					system paths.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Reference</h3>
				<p>A reference allows any abstract syntax tree node to link to a declared element. The reference might
					be from a type name in a variable declaration and would link to the declared element of that type.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Type System</h3>
				<p>A "type system" is represented through an interface hierarchy, distinct from but related to the
					declared elements in a programming environment. It serves to model and describe the usage scenarios
					of declared elements, such as classes or types, which aren't adequately represented by the declared
					elements themselves.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Control Flow Graph</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>A control flow graph (CFG) is a graphical representation of all paths that might be traversed
							through a program during its execution. Nodes represent basic blocks, and edges represent
							possible flow of control.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img
							src="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc110y/fall/notes/17-graphs/images/one-iteration-simple.svg">
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Call Graph</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>A Call Graph is a representation of the calling relationships between subroutines (functions
							or methods) in a program.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">

				<h2>Caching</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Why cache?</h3>
				<p>Parsing and indexing of project files are expensive in terms of performance.</p>
				<p>Therefore, all parsing and indexing should be incremental.</p>
				<p>Caches are needed to store snapshots of project and PSI models and to allow their incremental
					updates.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What to cache?</h3>
				<p>
					- VFS<br />
					- PSI<br />
					- Symbol tables<br />
					- Analysis outcomes<br />
					- Everything else
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Two kinds of caches</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>Persistent Caches</p>
						<p>
							- Stored in a database file<br />
							- Can be restored after IDE or project reloading<br />
							- Can be loaded by parts<br />
							- Slow
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p>In-memory Caches</p>
						<p>
							- Stored in RAM<br />
							- Cannot be restored after IDE or project reloading<br />
							- Fast
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Life of a typical cache</h3>
				<p>1. <b>Build</b> the initial state <br />
					2. <b>Merge</b> new data on updates from the file system or PSI <br />
					3. <b>Drop</b>
				</p>
				<p>For a persistent cache: <br />
					1. <b>Load</b> from a disk <br />
					2. <b>MergeLoad</b> - load and merge an additional part from a disk <br />
					3. <b>Save</b> to a disk
				</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Unit of Work</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Why Transactions?</h3>
				<p>Transactional updates ensure data integrity and consistency by treating a series of operations as a
					single, indivisible <b>unit of work</b>, either fully completing or fully rolling back.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Atomicity:</strong> Guarantees all-or-nothing, preventing partial updates and
					inconsistencies.<br />
					<strong>Consistency:</strong> Maintains system integrity by adhering to predefined rules.<br />
					<strong>Isolation:</strong> Manages concurrent modifications and prevents conflicts between
					transactions.<br />
					<strong>Durability:</strong> Makes changes permanent, ensuring they survive subsequent
					failures.<br />
					<strong>Undo Mechanism:</strong> Facilitates error recovery by rolling back erroneous
					transactions.<br />
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Unit of Work</h3>
				<p>
					The <strong>Unit of Work</strong> is a design pattern in software development used to maintain a
					list of objects affected by a business transaction. It manages the entire process of tasks from
					start to end, ensuring cohesion and completeness in handling multiple changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Manages transactional state, maintaining a list of tasks that are
					either to be committed to the database or reverted in case of errors.<br />
					<strong>Benefits:</strong> Ensures data consistency, manages dependencies between tasks, and
					optimizes performance by batching database operations.<br />
					<strong>Application in IDEs:</strong> It manages the transactions related to modifications in the
					Program Structure Interface (PSI), ensuring consistency and integrity in project states.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How to Implement Unit of Work</h3>
				<p>- Create an instance of "unit of work"<br />
					- Register all operations<br />
					- Ensure that the model is available for updates (depending on the concurrency model)<br />
					- Execute all operations one by one on a locked part of the model<br />
					- If any operation fails - rollback all executed operations (or just restore the non-updated version
					of the model)<br />
				</p>
