				<h2>Project Model</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Typical IDE Project Handling Capabilities</h3>
				<p>
					- Managing Project Files and Directories<br />
					- Handling Dependencies and Libraries<br />
					- Configuration Management<br />
					- Create new project from templates <br />
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Project Model in IDE</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>Project Models in IDE represent the structure and organization of the projects, including
							files, directories, dependencies, and configurations:</p>
						<p>- API to describe and manage project elements<br />
							- Notifications about project changes<br />
							- Facets to provide "configured" views of project (for example, project with different sets
							of
							referenced libraries depending on target OS)</p>
					</div>

				<h3>Project Model Kinds</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">

						<p>- VCS</p>
						<p>- Build Configuration</p>
						<p>- Metadata</p>

				<h2>Virtual File Systems</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What is VFS?</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>A Virtual File System (VFS) in an IDE serves as an abstraction layer that enables the
							efficient interaction between the IDE and the underlying file system, providing a unified
							interface to access files irrespective of their location.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="https://example.com/virtual-file-system-image.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Why VFS?</h3>
				<p>Universal API for working with files regardless of their actual location (on disk, in an archive, on
					an HTTP server, etc.).</p>
				<p>Detecting and tracking changes in files providing ability to compare old and new versions of file.
				</p>
				<p>Enhancing performance and user experience by queueing and reducing IO operations.</p>
				<p>Providing ability to add additional data attributes to a file.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How to VFS?</h3>
				<p>1. Manage a persistent snapshot of files which has been requested through VFS.</p>
				<p>2. All operations with files should be executed on VFS.</p>
				<p>3. Queue operations with real files and execute then on a single background thread asynchronously.
					Try to hold file lock for a minimal amount of time.</p>
				<p>4. Track and queue external changes. Execute them on snapshot when IDE requires "refresh".</p>
				<p>5. "Refresh" VFS on IDE startup, on switch from other application, etc.</p>
				<p>6. Notify subscribers on changes.</p>

				<h2>Program Structure Interface (PSI)</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What is PSI?</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>The Program Structure Interface (PSI) is a pivotal component in JetBrains IDEs. It enables
							the
							IDE to parse source code into a structured and navigable format, allowing developers to
							navigate, modify, and analyze the code efficiently.</p>
						<p>The PSI organizes code into trees and graphs, representing the hierarchical and structural
							relationship between
							various elements of the source code, from classes and methods to variables and expressions.
						</p>
						<p>IDE utilizes
							them to facilitate features like code analysis, refactoring, and completion.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="https://example.com/introduction-to-psi-image.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Files and Modules</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>Semantic views of files and "file sets" that can incapsulate other elements and provide
							different scope of views from other modules.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="https://example.com/introduction-to-psi-image.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Abstract Syntax Tree</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>Data structure used to represent the contents of a file, where each node in the tree denotes
							a construct in the source code.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="https://example.com/introduction-to-psi-image.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Declared Element</h3>
				<p>A declared element is "something that has declarations". This can be a
					class declaration, or a method declaration, or something not even related to code - HTML
					elements, CSS classes and even colours and file system paths.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Reference</h3>
				<p>Reference allows any abstract syntax tree node to link to a declared element. The reference might be
					from a type name in
					a
					variable declaration, and would link to the declared element of that type.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Type System</h3>
				<p>A "type system" is represented through an interface hierarchy, distinct from but related to
					the declared elements in a programming environment. It serves to model and describe the
					usage scenarios of declared elements, such as classes or types, which aren't adequately
					represented by the declared elements themselves.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>PSI - Control Flow Graph</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>A control flow graph (CFG) is a graphical representation of all paths that might be traversed
							through a program during its execution, where nodes represent basic blocks and edges
							represent possible flow of control.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="https://example.com/introduction-to-psi-image.jpg">

			<section>
				<h2>Caching</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Why to cache?</h3>
				<p>Parsing and indexing of project files are EXPENSIVE in terms of perfomance.</p>
				<p>So, all parsing and indexing should be INCREMENTAL.</p>
				<p>We need caches to store snapshot of project and PSI models and to allow it's incremental updates.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What to cache?</h3>
				<p>- VFS</p>
				<p>- PSI</p>
				<p>- Symbol tables</p>
				<p>- Everything else</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Two kinds of caches</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>Persistent Caches
						<p>-Stored in a database in file<br />
							-Can be restored after IDE or project reloading<br />
							- Can be loaded by parts<br />
							- Slow
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p>In-memory Caches
						<p>- Stored in a RAM<br />
							- Cannot be restored after IDE or project reloading<br />
							- Fast
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Life of typical cache</h3>
				<p> 1. <b>Build</b> initial state <br />
					2. <b>Merge</b> new data on updates from file system or PSI <br />
					3. <b>Drop</b>
				</p>
				<p>For persistent cache: <br />
					1. <b>Load</b> from a disk <br />
					2. <b>MergeLoad</b> - load and merge additional part from a disk <br />
					3. <b>Save</b> to a disk
			</section>

				<h2>Unit of Work</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Why transactions?</h3>
				<p>Transactional updates ensure data integrity and consistency by treating a series of operations as a
					single, indivisible <b>unit of work</b>, either fully completing or fully rolling back.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Atomicity:</strong> Ensures all-or-nothing, preventing partial updates and
					inconsistencies.<br />
					<strong>Consistency:</strong> Maintains system integrity by adhering to predefined rules.<br />
					<strong>Isolation:</strong> Manages concurrent modifications and prevents conflicts between
					transactions.<br />
					<strong>Durability:</strong> Makes changes permanent, surviving subsequent failures.<br />
					<strong>Undo Mechanism:</strong> Facilitates error recovery by rolling back erroneous
					transactions.<br />
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Unit of Work</h3>
				<p>
					The <strong>Unit of Work</strong> is a design pattern in software development used to maintain a
					list of objects affected by a business transaction. It manages the whole process of tasks from start
					to end, ensuring cohesion and completeness in handling multiple changes.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Manages transactional state, maintaining a list of tasks that
					are either to be committed to the database or reverted in case of errors.<br />
					<strong>Benefits:</strong> Ensures data consistency, manages dependencies between tasks, and
					optimizes performance by batching database operations.<br />
					<strong>Application in IDEs:</strong> It manages the transactions related to modifications in
					the Program Structure Interface (PSI), ensuring consistency and integrity in project states.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How to "Unit of Work"</h3>
				<p>- Create instance of "unit of work" <br />
					- Register all operations <br />
					- Ensure that model is available for updates (depending on concurrency model) <br />
					- Execute all operations one by one on a locked part of model<br />
					- If any operation failed - rollback all executed operations (or just restore non-updated version on
					model)<br />
				</p>
