							width="700" />
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p>The "Find Usages" feature is a crucial tool in IDEs that empowers developers to pinpoint
							every instance where a specific symbol, like a variable, method, or class, is utilized in
							the codebase. This functionality is pivotal for assessing the ramifications of code
							modifications, aiding in effective refactoring, and ensuring code integrity.</p>
					</div>

				<h2>Code Generation and Modification</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Code Generation</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<img src="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/screenshots/20171/create_from_usage.gif"
							width="700" />
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p>Code generation in IDEs automates the creation of code snippets and structures, significantly
							reducing manual coding effort. It enhances productivity by generating reliable,
							pattern-based code for common programming tasks, like setting up boilerplate code,
							implementing patterns, or creating CRUD operations. This feature is especially useful in
							large projects where consistency and adherence to design patterns are crucial.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h3>Refactorings</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<img src="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/screenshots/50/rename_refactoring_in_XAML.png"
							width="700" />
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p>Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its
							external behavior. It's a vital aspect of software maintenance and evolution, aimed at
							improving the non-functional attributes of the code. Common refactoring activities include
							renaming variables for clarity, breaking down large functions into smaller ones, and
							reorganizing code for better readability and maintainability. IDEs assist in refactoring by
							automating these tasks and ensuring that changes do not affect the program's functionality.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Quickfixes and Context Actions</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">

						<img src="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/screenshots/20163/qf_vs_ca.png"
							width="700" />
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							Quickfixes in IDEs are automated solutions offered to resolve detected code issues, like
							syntax errors or potential bugs. They provide immediate and context-sensitive corrections
							that improve code quality and adherence to best practices. Context Actions, on the other
							hand, are proactive suggestions not necessarily tied to code problems but aimed at enhancing
							code readability, structure, or performance. Unlike Quickfixes, which are often essential
							for code correctness, Context Actions offer optional, yet beneficial, transformations and
							refactorings to improve the overall quality and maintainability of the code.

				<h3>How to Implement?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Analyze PSI:</strong> Examine PSI to understand the current
						code structure and identify what should be done.</li>
					<li><strong>Modify/Create PSI:</strong> Based on the refactoring needs, modify existing PSI elements
						or create new ones to represent the desired changes.</li>
					<li><strong>Validate Updated PSI:</strong> Ensure that the changes made to the PSI are valid and do
						not break the code structure or logic.</li>
					<li><strong>Fix Issues:</strong> Address any issues or inconsistencies identified during the PSI
						validation step.</li>
					<li><strong>Materialize Updated PSI Nodes:</strong> Convert the modified or newly created PSI
						elements into actual code changes.</li>
					<li><strong>Replace Old Code with New:</strong> Apply the final changes to the codebase by replacing
						the old code with the newly generated code, ensuring a seamless transition and maintaining code
						integrity.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How to Implement?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Modification:</strong> Utilize the UnitOfWork pattern or PSI transactions for safe and
						atomic code modifications. This approach allows for grouping a series of changes into a single
						operation, ensuring consistency and enabling easier rollback if needed.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Validation:</strong> Conduct thorough checks for name conflicts, correct usage of
						variables and methods, and proper module imports. This step is crucial to avoid introducing
						errors into the codebase and to ensure that the refactoring aligns with the existing code
						architecture and dependencies.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Materialization:</strong> Traverse the PSI nodes in-depth to generate new code segments.
						Carefully replace the old code with the new, ensuring that the new code integrates seamlessly
						with the rest of the project. This process involves not just the physical replacement of code
						but also the preservation of code formatting, comments, and other non-functional elements.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Challenges</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Behavioral Preservation:</strong> Ensuring that the refactored code maintains the same
						external behavior and functionality as the original.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Consistency:</strong> Achieving consistency in both code structure and design patterns
						across the entire codebase. Refactoring should unify disparate coding practices to ensure
						uniformity, which is especially challenging in large or legacy codebases with varied coding
						styles and practices.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Bulk Updates:</strong> Managing bulk updates efficiently while ensuring accuracy and
						consistency is a significant challenge. It involves updating large portions of the codebase
						simultaneously, which can introduce risks of mass errors or inconsistencies if not managed
						carefully.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Challenges</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Code Style:</strong> Maintaining a consistent code style during refactoring is crucial
						for readability and maintainability. Refactoring should adhere to the project's coding standards
						and style guides to ensure that the new code fits seamlessly with the existing codebase.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Comments:</strong> Preserving and updating comments during refactoring is essential to
						keep the code well-documented. However, it is challenging to update comments automatically to
						reflect changes in the code, often requiring manual review and adjustments.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Example: "Rename" Refactoring</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Identify Rename Scope:</strong> Analyze the codebase to determine the variables,
						methods, classes, or files to be renamed. This step includes identifying all references to these
						elements throughout the project to ensure a comprehensive renaming.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Symbol Resolution:</strong> Use symbol resolution techniques to accurately
						identify and distinguish all instances of the symbol. This ensures that only relevant references
						are affected by the rename operation, avoiding unintentional changes to unrelated code.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Conflict Detection:</strong> Scan for potential naming conflicts or
						ambiguities that might arise from the renaming. This involves checking against existing names in
						the scope and considering language-specific naming rules.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Example: "Rename" Refactoring</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>User Input and Preview:</strong> Engage the user in the process by allowing them to
						input the new name and providing a preview of the changes. This step includes showing the impact
						of the rename operation on various parts of the codebase.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Refactoring Execution:</strong> Execute the renaming process across the entire PSI,
						ensuring that all identified references are updated consistently and
						correctly, thereby maintaining the integrity of the codebase.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Materialize Changes:</strong> Reflect the changes made in the PSI in the project files.
						This includes updating the code files, any related documentation, and ensuring that the changes
						persist across the development environment.
					</li>
				</ul>
