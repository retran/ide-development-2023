				<h2>What is a Debugger?</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What is a Debugger?</h3>
				<p>A debugger is a software tool used by programmers to inspect and manipulate the execution of a
					computer program. It helps in identifying and fixing bugs or errors in the code.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Purpose of a Debugger</h3>
				<p>The primary purpose of a debugger is to allow programmers to see what is happening 'inside' a program
					while it executes or what the program was doing at the moment it crashed.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Machine-level Debuggers</h3>
				<p>Machine-level debuggers enable debugging at the low-level assembly or machine code, offering granular
					control and deep insights into the program's execution at the hardware level.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Source-level Debuggers</h3>
				<p>Source-level debuggers allow developers to debug programs at the high-level source code level,
					providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for code inspection and debugging.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Standalone Debuggers</h3>
				<p>Standalone debuggers are separate applications dedicated to debugging. They are often more
					specialized and can be used independently of any specific IDE.</p>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Integrated Debuggers</h3>
				<p>Integrated debuggers are built into IDEs, offering a seamless debugging experience within the
					development environment, with features tailored to the IDE's supported languages and frameworks.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Remote Debugging</h3>
				<p>Remote debugging refers to the process of debugging a program running on a different system (server,
					virtual machine, or container) from the debugger itself, allowing developers to diagnose issues in
					different environments.</p>
				<img src="path_to_remote_debugging_setup_image.jpg" alt="Remote Debugging Setup">
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Applications of Remote Debugging</h3>
				<p>This technique is particularly useful for debugging applications in complex environments, such as
					cloud-based architectures, where direct access to the execution environment is not feasible.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Multi-threaded Application Debugging</h3>
				<p>Debugging multi-threaded applications involves unique challenges due to the concurrent execution of
					threads, making it harder to predict and replicate specific states and issues.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Multi-threaded Debugging</h3>
				<p>Effective techniques include setting thread-specific breakpoints, inspecting thread states, and
					monitoring synchronization mechanisms like locks and semaphores.</p>

			<section>
				<h3>REPL</h3>
				<p>A Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) is a simple, interactive computer programming environment. It allows
					for the execution of user inputs and returns the results to the user. REPLs enable piecewise
					execution of programs.</p>
				<p>In a REPL environment, user inputs are read, evaluated (executed), and the results of this evaluation
					are then printed out. This loop provides an interactive space for testing and debugging code.</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Evolution of Debuggers</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>1950s: Simple Logging Methods</h3>
				<p>In the 1950s, debugging was a rudimentary process, largely based on the use of print statements and
					manual logging. Developers relied on inserting print commands in their code to output variable
					values and program states to a console or log file. This method, although primitive, was crucial for
					early software development, allowing programmers to track the flow of execution and understand where
					errors might be occurring.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>1970s: Introduction of Interactive Debuggers</h3>
				<p>The 1970s introduced a significant advancement in debugging technology with the emergence of
					interactive debuggers. These tools allowed developers to interact with running programs, setting
					breakpoints, and inspecting program state in real-time. This innovation marked a departure from
					static logging methods, providing a more dynamic and efficient approach to troubleshooting code.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>1990s: Emergence of Integrated Debuggers in IDEs</h3>
				<p>The 1990s saw the integration of debuggers into Integrated Development Environments (IDEs),
					significantly boosting developer productivity. This integration brought debugging tools directly
					into the software development workflow, offering a seamless experience. Features like graphical
					interfaces, source code highlighting, and context-aware debugging became commonplace, drastically
					simplifying the debugging process.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>2000s Milestones</h3>
				<p>Debugging took another major stride in the 2000s with the introduction of advanced features like
					remote debugging and support for multi-threaded applications. Remote debugging allowed developers to
					diagnose issues in software running on different machines or environments, while multi-threading
					support was crucial for debugging more complex, performance-oriented applications.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>2010s: Advanced Features in Debugging</h3>
				<p>The 2010s continued the trend of innovation in debugging with the further development of advanced
					features. Debuggers became more sophisticated in handling remote systems and multi-threaded
					applications, enabling developers to tackle increasingly complex software challenges. These
					developments reflected the evolving landscape of software engineering, where applications often
					spanned multiple platforms and environments.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Influence of Programming Languages on Debugger Evolution</h3>
				<p>The evolution of debugger technologies has been closely linked to the development of programming
					languages, with each new language paradigm introducing unique debugging challenges and needs.</p>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h3>Early Programming Languages</h3>
				<p>In the era of early programming languages like Fortran and COBOL, debugging tools were rudimentary,
					focused mainly on identifying syntax errors and basic runtime issues.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Object-Oriented Languages</h3>
				<p>The rise of object-oriented languages like Java and C++ necessitated debuggers that could handle
					complexities like class hierarchies, object states, and encapsulation.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Modern Languages</h3>
				<p>Contemporary languages with advanced features, including concurrency and parallelism, have driven the
					development of sophisticated debuggers capable of handling complex execution flows and environments.

				<h2>Features</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Setting Breakpoints</h3>
				<p>Breakpoints are fundamental to debugging, allowing developers to pause program execution at specific
					points. They enable close examination of the state and behavior of the program at critical moments.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Conditional Breakpoints: Trigger based on specific conditions.</li>
					<li>Line Breakpoints: Pause execution at a particular line in the code.</li>
					<li>Function Breakpoints: Activate when a certain function is called.</li>
					<li>Exception Breakpoints: Activate when a certain exception is thrown.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Stepping Through Code</h3>
				<p>This feature allows developers to execute code one line or instruction at a time. It's crucial for
					understanding the flow of execution and pinpointing where things go wrong.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Step Over: Executes the next line of code, skipping functions.</li>
					<li>Step Into: Moves into functions or methods for a deeper look.</li>
					<li>Step Out: Exits the current function and returns to the caller.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Inspecting Variables</h3>
				<p>Inspecting variables is a key feature allowing developers to view and analyze the current state of
					variables at any point during program execution.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Call Stack Inspection</h3>
				<p>The call stack is a record of active function calls in the program, showing which functions are
					running, where they were called from, and the state of their local variables. Inspecting the call
					stack helps in tracing the path of execution and understanding program flow.</p>
				<p>Inspecting the call stack is particularly useful for diagnosing errors and understanding complex
					execution flows, especially in the case of nested function calls or recursive algorithms.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Variable Inspection Tools</h3>
				<p>Most debuggers provide a watch window or similar tools to monitor the values of variables, helping
					developers understand how data changes over the course of execution.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Modifying Program State</h3>
				<p>Debuggers often allow for the modification of the program state, including changing variable values,
					to test different scenarios and understand the impact of such changes.</p>
				<p>This feature is particularly useful for testing how different inputs affect program behavior without
					the need to stop and restart the program.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Expression Evaluation</h3>
				<p>Expression evaluation in debuggers allows developers to execute code snippets or evaluate expressions
					on the fly. This is useful for testing hypotheses about code behavior or inspecting values without
					modifying the source code.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Hot Reloading</h3>
				<p>Hot reloading refers to the ability of a debugger to apply changes in the code on the fly without
					needing to restart the application. This feature greatly enhances the development workflow by
					allowing immediate feedback on code modifications.</p>
				<p>Hot reloading saves time and improves productivity by reducing the need for repetitive restarts and
					recompilations. It enables a more interactive and responsive development experience.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Implementation</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Debugger Symbols</h3>
				<p>Debugger symbols are markers or labels added to software programs during the development process.
					They are used to establish a link between compiled binary code and the source code. They
					include information like variable and function names, line numbers, and file names, which are
					essential for debugging.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How do Breakpoints work?</h3>
				<p>Hardware breakpoints are implemented at the chipset level. They use comparators to match the
					instruction being executed with a preset instruction in a peripheral register. When a match occurs,
					a debug event is triggered, halting the processor or generating an exception. The number of hardware
					breakpoints is typically limited due to hardware constraints.</p>
				<p>Software breakpoints are implemented by the debugger itself. They function by modifying the code to
					insert a breakpoint instruction or an instruction that causes a fault, thereby triggering a debug
					event. Unlike hardware breakpoints, software breakpoints can be virtually unlimited, although they
					face challenges like unpatchability of certain code regions (e.g., Read-Only Memory) and potential
					code corruption if the debugger crashes.</p>
				<p>Software breakpoints in some systems (like x86 architecture) use software interrupts, or 'traps,' to
					implement breakpoints. The `int 3` instruction in x86 is an example, causing the operating system to
					stop the process and send a signal, typically `SIGTRAP`, to the debugger.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How does Stepping work?</h3>
				<p>Historically, instruction stepping involved stopping the processor clock and manually advancing it
					one cycle at a time. This required a control to stop the clock, a second control to manually advance
					the clock, and a means of recording the state of the processor after each cycle.</p>
				<p>In modern processors, similar functionality to manual stepping is achieved via a trap flag. This
					flag, when enabled, instructs the processor to stop after each instruction, functioning similarly to
					a breakpoint.</p>
				<p>Instead of using a physical stop button, modern debuggers employ breakpoints or a 'Pause' request.
					The debugger might also use system calls like `ptrace` on Linux to control the execution of a
					process, stopping it at specific points or after each instruction using signals like `SIGTRAP`.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How does Call Stack Inspection works</h3>
				<p>When a program stops at a breakpoint, the debugger provides information about the current state,
					including the current function and its callers. This is achieved by tracing function calls and
					maintaining a record of active function calls in the program. This function
					records the current state of the program, including the call stack, enabling the inspection of the
					sequence of function calls.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How does Expression Evaluator Work</h3>
				<p>Evaluating an expression involves a complex interplay among the debug engine (DE), the symbol
					provider (SP), the binder object, and the expression evaluator (EE). The EE takes an expression from
					the DE in the form of a string and evaluates it using various interfaces.</p>
				<p>The EE uses the binder object, provided by the DE, to get the value of symbols and objects in the
					program.</p>
				<p>Some debuggers, like Visual Studio, employ debugger intrinsic functions that allow the evaluation of
					certain functions without altering the application state. These intrinsic functions are safe to
					execute and can be used in all expressions.</p>
