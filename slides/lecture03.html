				<h3>Today's Agenda</h3>
				<p>
					Today, we will delve deep into the functionalities and features of text editors, exploring topics
					such as syntax highlighting, code navigation, document markup, typing assistance, and customization
					options. We will also discuss the importance of inclusive design and accessibility in text editors
					to ensure a diverse and inclusive user experience.
				</p>

				<h2>Features</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					Text editors are pivotal components of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). They play a
					crucial role in software development by providing developers with the tools to write, edit, and
					optimize code efficiently. A well-designed text editor enhances code readability and accelerates the
					development process, contributing to the overall quality of software products.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							Syntax highlighting is a feature that displays source code in different colors and fonts
							according to the category of terms. This feature is crucial for developers as it increases
							the readability of the code, helps in debugging, and allows developers to distinguish easily
							between different elements of the code, such as keywords, variables, and symbols.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">

					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Lexical vs Semantic Syntax Highlighting</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							<b>Lexical syntax highlighting</b> relies on recognizing the syntax of the programming
							language, coloring keywords, strings, and other elements according to predefined rules. It
							is faster but less accurate, as it doesnâ€™t understand the context or the semantics of the
							code.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							<b>Semantic syntax highlighting</b>, on the other hand, involves understanding the code's
							context and meaning. It provides more accurate and meaningful highlighting, distinguishing
							between variables, functions, and types based on their roles and usage in the code, but may
							be more resource-intensive.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Error Highlighting</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							Error highlighting is a crucial feature in text editors within IDEs. It provides immediate
							visual feedback to developers about errors in the code. By underlining or changing the color
							of erroneous code, it allows developers to quickly identify and rectify mistakes, enhancing
							code quality and reducing debugging time.
						</p>
						<p>
							This feature often works in tandem with other tools like linters and compilers to provide
							accurate and meaningful error information, helping developers understand the nature and
							location of the errors, and sometimes even offering suggestions for fixes.

				<h3>Keyboard Accessibility</h3>
				<p>
					UI should be designed to ensure that all its functionalities are navigable and operable through a
					keyboard interface, emphasizing keyboard accessibility as a critical component to guarantee
					universal access to information without the necessity of a mouse. For a UI to be considered
					keyboard accessible, it must not only be operable via keyboard but must also integrate the following
					elements: a discernible keyboard focus, a logical tab order, and it must prevent keyboard traps.</p>
				<p>
					Keyboard accessibility is vital for users with mobility impairments. It allows users to navigate and
					interact with the text editor using keyboard shortcuts and commands, ensuring that the software is
					usable and accessible to a wider range of individuals.
