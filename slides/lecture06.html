				<h2>Semantic Analysis</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Semantic Analysis</h3>
				<p>Ensuring the source code not only "sounds right" but also "makes sense" within the context of the
					language's rules.</p>
				<h5>Purpose of Semantic Analysis</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Understands the meaning of syntactically correct code.</li>
					<li>Determines valid meaning within the language's rules.</li>
					<li>Operates on the abstract syntax tree (AST) or other intermediate representations.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Key Operations in Semantic Analysis</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Name and Reference Resolution:</b> Mapping symbolic names to their actual definitions or
						declarations.</li>
					<li><b>Scope Rules Enforcement:</b> Valid access of variables and functions.</li>
					<li><b>Type Checking:</b> Compatibility of data types in operations.</li>
					<li><b>Variable Binding:</b> Confirmation of variable declaration and initialization.</li>
					<li><b>Function/Method Binding:</b> Validity of function or method calls.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Errors Detected by Semantic Analysis</h3>
				<p>While syntax errors are about code structure, semantic errors delve into logical mistakes.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Using an undefined variable.</li>
					<li>Out-of-bounds array access.</li>
					<li>Incorrect function call arguments.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><code>int result = "hello" + 5;</code></p>
				<p>Syntactically correct but semantically problematic in many statically-typed languages.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Symbols and Name Resolution</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Symbols and References</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Symbols</b> represent named entities in programming languages.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the context of a symbol table, a symbol can refer to variables, functions, classes, modules, or
					any other identifiable construct in
					code. The symbol table stores information about each symbol, such as its location, type, and scope.
				</p>

				<p><b> Reference </b> of a symbol refers to a specific occurrence in the code where the value associated
					with
					that symbol is accessed or used, rather than where it's defined or declared.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Name Resolution (aka "Symbol Resolution" or simply "Resolve")</h3>
				<p>
					Symbol resolution, often referred to as "name resolution" or "binding", is the process by which a
					compiler, interpreter or IDE maps a symbol in the source code
					to its corresponding declaration or definition. This is essential for ensuring that the correct
					piece of data or functionality is accessed when a symbol is referenced. </p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Name Resolution</h3>
				<p>The IDE evaluates the scoping rules of the language to deduce potential locations where the
					symbol's definition might reside. This can range from the enclosing block for local variables to
					module or namespace levels for global ones.</p>

				<p>If a symbol isn't found in the nearest scope, the IDE explores enclosing or parent scopes. For
					instance, in object-oriented languages, a base class will be inspected if a method is absent in a
					derived class.</p>

				<p>For languages with support for function or operator overloading, the resolution process takes
					into account the symbol's usage context, like argument types and quantity, to determine the
					correct overload.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Name Resolution</h3>
				<p>For languages that bifurcate compilation and linking, resolution can be twofold. During compilation,
					symbols are checked within the current translation unit, while during linking, resolution spans
					across units.</p>

				<p>Languages or systems that allow dynamic linking can have symbol resolution during runtime. This is
					typical when libraries or modules are dynamically loaded and linked.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Resolution Errors</h3>
				<p>If a symbol remains unresolved, the compiler or interpreter flags a resolution error, signaling that
					a declaration or definition for the symbol was not located.</p>

				<p>IDE typically marks symbol as unresolved and continues the process taking in account that symbol does
					not have useful meaning. </p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Scopes, Lifetimes, and Nesting</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Scopes</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Scope</b> determines the region or portion of the code where a symbol can be accessed or
					modified.
				</p>
				<p>
					It defines the visibility and accessibility of a symbol. Scopes can be nested, meaning
					a
					scope can be contained within another scope. Typical scopes include local (inside a function or
					method), class (inside a class), and global (accessible throughout the code).</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Lifetimes</h3>
				<p>
					Lifetime refers to the duration or period during program execution when a symbol exists in memory.
				</p>
				<p>
					It starts when memory is allocated for the symbol and ends when the memory is deallocated. Lifetime
					is closely tied to scope in many programming languages. For instance, a variable with local scope
					usually
					has a lifetime that lasts as long as the function containing it is executing.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Nesting</h3>
				<p><b>Nesting</b> in programming denotes the encapsulation of one scope or structure within another.</p>
				<p> This hierarchical organization, evident in constructs like nested loops or functions within
					functions,
					facilitates a layered access to symbols. Through nesting, inner scopes can reference outer scope
					symbols while maintaining the capability to shadow or override them, ensuring clarity and precision
					in symbol utilization.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Symbol Qualifiers</h3>
				<p>
					A <b>symbol qualifier</b>, often simply called a "qualifier", is a prefix to a symbol that provides
					a more
					specific context to that symbol.
				</p>
				<p>Examples: namespace, package or module qualifiers, class or object qualifiers, etc. </p>
				<p> It's used to disambiguate symbols that might have the same name but
					reside in different scopes or namespaces.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="small">
				<h3>Example</h3>
				<pre>
					<code data-trim data-noescape>
						// Global scope
						int globalVariable = 100;  // Has a global scope and lifetime extending the entire execution of the program

						class Program
						{
							// Class-level scope
							static int classVariable = 50;  // Has a class-level scope and lifetime as long as the containing class is in memory

							static void Main(string[] args)
							{
								// Method-level scope
								int localVariable = 10;  // Has a method-level scope and lifetime limited to the execution of the Main method

								Console.WriteLine(globalVariable);  // Accessible because it's in a global scope
																	// "Console." is a class qualifier.
								Console.WriteLine(classVariable);   // Accessible because it's in the class scope

								if (true)
								{
									// Block-level scope
									int blockVariable = 5;  // Has a block-level scope and lifetime limited to this if-block

									Console.WriteLine(localVariable);   // Accessible because the block is inside the method
									Console.WriteLine(blockVariable);   // Accessible within its own block
								}

								// Console.WriteLine(blockVariable);  // This would be an error. blockVariable is out of scope here.
							}

							static void AnotherMethod()
							{
								// Console.WriteLine(localVariable);  // This would be an error. localVariable is out of scope since it's local to Main.
								Console.WriteLine(classVariable);   // Accessible because it's in the class scope
							}
						}
					</code>
				</pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Scope Resolution</h3>
				<p>Scope resolution refers to the process by which a compiler or interpreter determines which variable,
					function, or other symbol a reference in the code pertains to, especially when there are multiple
					symbols with the same name in different scopes. The process involves checking various scopes in a
					hierarchical manner until the appropriate symbol is found or until it's determined that the symbol
					does not exist in any accessible scope.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Symbol Tables</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Symbol Tables</h3>
				<p>A symbol table is a data structure used by compilers, interpreters, and IDEs to store information
					about symbols (such as variable names, function names, class names, etc.) used in the source
					code of a program. It plays a crucial role in the process of name binding, wherein symbolic names in
					the source code are associated (or "bound") with specific memory addresses, data types, or
					functionalities in the compiled or interpreted code.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Role of Symbol Tables</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<ul>
							<li>Name Binding</li>
							<li>Data Storage</li>
							<li>Scoping</li>
							<li>Error Checking</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
								struct SymbolTableEntry {
									string name;
									string type;
									int scopeLevel;
									// ... other attributes ...
								};
							</code>
						</pre>
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Role of Symbol Tables</h3>
				<p>Associating symbolic names in the source code with specific attributes such as memory addresses, data
					types, or functionalities in the compiled or interpreted code.</p>
				<p>Managing different scopes in a program to ensure names are resolved in the correct context. This
					includes local vs. global scopes and nested scopes.</p>
				<p>Using symbol tables, compilers can detect errors such as use of undeclared variables, type
					mismatches, and redeclaration of variables.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Role of Symbol Tables</h3>
				<p>Storing attributes for each symbol:</p>
				<p>
					Type (int, float, etc.)<br />
					Scope (local, global)<br />
					References to PSI trees and` declared elements<br />
					Any other relevant data<br />

				<h3>Common Implementation</h3>
				<P>
					<b>Hash Tables:</b> Fast lookups, ideal for unordered data.<br />
					<b>Trees:</b> Hierarchical structure, suited for nested scopes.<br />
					<b>Linked Lists:</b> Sequential access, simpler but slower.
				</p>

				<h3>Spaghetti Stack</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>Facilitates the construction of a symbol table and scope hierarchy during AST traversal.</p>
						<p><b>push</b> - Introduce a new child node and designate it as the top of the stack.</p>
						<p><b>pop</b> - Revert to the parent node as the new top of the stack.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Spaghettistack.svg/800px-Spaghettistack.svg.png"
							width="300" />
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Spaghetti Stack</h3>
				<p>During traversal, the compiler encounters constructs like loops, conditionals, and functions. Each
					potentially introduces a new scope.</p>
				<p>As nested constructs are encountered, the spaghetti stack manages these scopes. New scopes link to
					parent scopes using the stack.</p>
				<p>The stack maintains a hierarchy. The top represents the current scope, while deeper elements
					represent outer scopes. Symbols are added to the current scope's table as encountered.</p>
				<p>For symbol references, the compiler starts at the current scope and navigates the stack's hierarchy
					until the symbol is found or deemed undefined.</p>

				<h2> IDE-specific usages and challenges </h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How IDEs Utilize Symbol Tables</h3>
				<h5>Error Checking</h5>
				<p>Identify unresolved symbols or symbols used out of their intended context.</p>
				<h5>Type Checking and Inference</h5>
				<p>Perform type checks, suggest type-specific methods, and infer types using symbol table data.</p>
				<h5>Syntax and Semantic Highlighting</h5>
				<p>Differentiate symbols using colors and styles based on their nature and context.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How IDEs Utilize Symbol Tables</h3>
				<h5>Code Navigation</h5>
				<p>
					<b>Go to Symbol</b>: Jump to the source of a symbol's declaration using part of the name.<br />
					<b>Go to Definition</b>: Jump to the source of a symbol's declaration.<br />
					<b>Find References/Usages</b>: List all references of a symbol in the project.
				</p>
				<h5>Auto-completion</h5>
				<p>Offer relevant symbol suggestions based on context for faster and error-free coding.</p>
				<h5>Refactorings</h5>
				<p>Consistently rename symbols throughout the project using the symbol table.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>How IDEs Utilize Symbol Tables</h5>
				<h5>Code Documentation and Tooltips</h5>
				<p>Display symbol metadata, like documentation or type information, as tooltips.</p>
				<h5>Scope and Lifetime Visualization</h5>
				<p>Highlight or indicate the scope and lifetime of variables based on symbol table structure.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>Debugging</h5>
				<p>Resolve variable names, display call stacks, and evaluate expressions during debugging sessions.</p>
				<h5>Code Generation</h5>
				<p>Generate code templates like "implement interface" or "override method" using the symbol table.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Challenges and Advanced Topics</h3>

				<h5>Incremental Updates</h5>
				<p>Maintain the spaghetti stack and replace subtrees according to updates to ensure the symbol table
					remains consistent with the code.</p>

				<h5>Third-Party Libraries and Dependencies</h5>
				<p>Handling symbols from external sources can be tricky. IDEs need to integrate symbols from third-party
					libraries and dependencies without overwhelming the developer or mixing them up with the project's
					own symbols. This often involves creating separate symbol tables or namespaces and ensuring they're
					correctly linked and accessible.</p>

				<h5>Overloading and Templates</h5>
				<p>Function overloading and templates introduce complexities as a single symbol name can represent
					multiple entities. The IDE needs to correctly identify and differentiate each overloaded function or
					template instantiation, ensuring type safety and correct navigation.</p>

				<h5>Resolving Symbols in Dynamic Languages</h5>
				<p>Dynamic languages, like Python or JavaScript, pose a unique challenge because types and symbols can
					change at runtime. IDEs use heuristic methods, type inference, and sometimes even runtime
					information to make educated guesses about symbol resolution in these contexts.</p>
			</section>

				<h3>Next: Understanding Programming Language Part 3</h3>
				<p>
					In our next session, we'll explore type systems and their role in programming. We'll also dive into
					semantic analysis, which helps interpret the meaning of code, and touch on type inference, which
					lets languages deduce types on their own. Join us for a deeper look into these essential topics.
