			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What is Plain Text?</h3>
				<p>Plain text refers to unformatted textual data. Unlike rich text, which can include styling and other
					elements, plain text consists solely of character data. An example of plain text is a simple `.txt`
					file containing the sentence "Hello, World!" without any bolding, italics, or other embellishments.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Plain Text vs Rich Text</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Comparison:</strong> While plain text only contains raw, unformatted characters, rich text
					can include formatting such as font styles, sizes, colors, and more. Rich text documents can also
					embed objects like images and tables.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Plain Text Example:</strong> "Hello, World!" in a `.txt` file.</li>
					<li><strong>Rich Text Example:</strong> "Hello, World!" in bold, italic, and underlined in a `.docx`
						or `.rtf` file, possibly with an accompanying image.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>RTF: Example of rich text format</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							Developed by Microsoft in the mid-1980s, RTF (Rich Text Format) is a proprietary document
							file format that supports text formatting, such as bold and italics, as well as graphics.
							Unlike plaintext, RTF retains style and formatting information, making it suitable for
							exchanging formatted documents between applications and platforms. While not as ubiquitous
							today, it has played a significant role in the evolution of document interchange formats.

				<h3>Benefits of Plain Text</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Universality:</strong> Almost every system can read and display plain text, making it
						universally accessible.</li>
					<li><strong>Compactness:</strong> Without formatting and extra metadata, plain text files are
						generally smaller in size.</li>
					<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The content is directly visible, without hidden data or metadata.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> It can be easily processed by many tools and software, from simple
						text editors to complex algorithms.</li>
					<li><strong>Stability:</strong> As a long-standing standard, plain text doesn't suffer from
						software-specific incompatibilities.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Limitations of Plain Text</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>No Formatting:</strong> Plain text cannot represent styles like bold or italic.</li>
					<li><strong>Limited Structuring:</strong> Without special conventions, plain text can't easily
						represent tables, columns, or other structured data.</li>
					<li><strong>No Media Embedding:</strong> Images, videos, or audio cannot be embedded within plain
						text.</li>
					<li><strong>Character Set Limitations:</strong> Depending on the encoding, certain characters might
						not be representable.</li>
				</ul>

					<div class="column">

						<p>
							ED (short for "editor") was one of the first command-line text editors, created in the early
							1970s.
							Designed by Ken Thompson for Unix systems, ED set the foundation for many text editors that
							followed. While primitive by today's standards, it introduced key editing concepts still
							used.

				<h3>First Display Text Editors</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							With the advent of video display terminals in the late 1970s and early 1980s, text editors
							evolved to show text directly on a screen rather than print them on paper. Editors like "vi"
							(on Unix) and "WordStar" (on DOS) emerged, offering users a visual interface to interact
							with their documents. They marked a significant shift from command-line based editors,
							providing real-time feedback and enhancing user experience.

							Developed in the mid-1970s by Richard Stallman, Emacs is more than just a text editor; it's
							an extensible and customizable editing environment. With its unique system of key bindings,
							and its own built-in programming language (Emacs Lisp), users can customize and extend their
							editing experience. It is renowned for its powerful features, enabling tasks from editing
							text to reading emails or even playing games, all within the same interface.

				<h3>The Underlying Representation</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							In computers, everything is stored as binary data â€“ sequences of 0s and 1s. Text is no
							exception. Each character is mapped to a unique number using a character encoding, like
							ASCII. For example, in ASCII encoding, the letter 'A' is represented as the number 65, which
							in binary is '01000001'. When we type a letter, the computer processes its binary
							representation, but displays the character we recognize, allowing us to interact using
							familiar symbols.

				<h3>Origins of ASCII</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							ASCII, standing for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, was developed in the
							early 1960s by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Designed as a standardized
							character encoding for electronic communication, ASCII represents text in computers,
							telecommunications equipment, and other devices that use text. Originally, it was created to
							address the compatibility issues between different types of data processing equipment.

				<h3>The ASCII Table</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						The ASCII table consists of 128 characters, encompassing control characters (like carriage
						return
						and line feed) and printable characters (letters, numbers, and symbols). Each character is
						represented by a unique 7-bit integer. This table became the backbone for text encoding in early
						computing and forms the foundation of many encoding systems used today.

			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Control Characters</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							Control characters, often non-printable and invisible, are special characters used in text
							to
							represent non-graphic instructions. Originating from the early days of telegraphy and
							teletype, they
							served to control the behavior of devices or instruct them to perform specific operations.
							In
							character encodings like ASCII, control characters occupy the first 32 codes (from 0 to 31).

			<section>
				<h3>Examples of Control Characters</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Carriage Return (CR):</strong> Moves the caret to the start of the line without
						advancing to the next line.</li>
					<li><strong>Line Feed (LF):</strong> Advances the caret to the next line without returning to the
						start.</li>
					<li><strong>Tab:</strong> Moves the caret to the next tab stop.</li>
					<li><strong>Escape:</strong> Often used to begin sequences of characters that represent special
						commands.</li>
					<li><strong>Backspace:</strong> Moves the caret backwards one space.</li>

				<h3>Why Different Encodings?</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">

						<p>
							Text encodings are essential because they define how characters are represented as numbers
							in computers. As the digital world expanded, the need arose for a system that could
							accommodate more than just English letters and symbols. Different regions and languages
							necessitated their own encoding schemes, leading to a plethora of text encodings tailored to
							various linguistic and technical needs.

				<h3>Introduction to Codepages</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">

						<p>
							Codepages are sets of characters for a particular encoding. In the era before Unicode,
							different regions used different codepages to represent their languages. For instance,
							Western European languages might use the ISO 8859-1 codepage, while Cyrillic-based languages
							might use ISO 8859-5. Switching between codepages was often necessary to display multiple
							languages correctly.

							KOI-8R (Kod Obmena Informatsiey-8 Rossiya) is an 8-bit character encoding, designed to cover
							Russian, which uses the Cyrillic script. Introduced in the 1980s, KOI-8R became one of the
							main encodings used in Unix-based systems in Russia. An interesting feature of KOI-8R is its
							resilience to transmission errors: if a single bit is lost, a Cyrillic letter turns into
							another Cyrillic letter.

				<h2>Text Editing under the Hood</h2>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Why Speed Matters in Text Editing</h3>
				<p>
					The efficiency of text operations directly impacts user productivity and satisfaction. Delays or
					lags during typing, searching, or other text-related tasks can disrupt the user's flow and
					concentration. As documents grow in size, the demand for instant response and smooth navigation
					becomes even more crucial. In competitive environments, the speed of a text editor can be the
					difference between a user adopting or abandoning the software.

				<h3>Text representation: Array of Chars</h3>
				<pre>
					<code data-trim data-noescape>
						val text : CharArray = CharArray(1024)</code></pre>
				<p>
					In its simplest form, text can be represented as an array of characters, where each element
					corresponds to a specific character. This approach works well for small texts and offers
					constant-time access to any character. However, insertions and deletions can be expensive
					operations, especially in large documents, as they may require shifting many elements.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Text representation: Array of Lines</h3>
				<pre>
					<code data-trim data-noescape>
						val text : Array&lt;String&gt; = Array&lt;String&gt;(1024)
						</code></pre>
				<p>
					Text can also be represented as an array of lines, where each element is a string or an array of
					characters representing a single line. This structure eases operations like line insertions and
					deletions. However, operations within a line still face the same challenges as the array of chars
					representation.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>The Need for Specialized Structures</h3>
				<p>
					While basic arrays offer straightforward text representation, they often struggle with dynamic
					editing needs. Insertions, deletions, and other modifications can become computationally expensive,
					especially in large documents. This inefficiency necessitates specialized data structures that
					optimize these operations, ensuring that text editors remain responsive and efficient even as the
					size and complexity of the text grows.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Text representation: Gap Buffer</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							The gap buffer is a dynamic array with a "gap" or empty space. Cursor movements and text
							edits occur at the gap's location. When characters are inserted, the gap size decreases, and
							when they're deleted, the gap size increases. The gap moves with the cursor, and while this
							requires moving the characters around, it ensures that insertion at the cursor location is
							always fast. Gap buffers are used in popular editors like Emacs.

			<section>
				<h3>Text representation: Piece Table</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							The piece table is a data structure that maintains original text and its modifications in
							separate buffers. Instead of editing the original content, modifications are stored
							separately, and a table keeps track of "pieces" of the content to construct the current
							state of the text. This approach makes operations like undo and redo very efficient. Piece
							tables were used in early word processors like Word for DOS.

				<h3>Text representation: Piece Tree and Rope</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							Ropes and piece trees are a binary-tree-based data structures where each leaf node holds a

							Trees efficiently handle operations like insertion, deletion, and concatenation by
							manipulating tree nodes rather
							than characters. Ropes have been employed in editors like Xi, while piece tree is utilized
							by VS Code.

							geometric shapes like curves and lines. Unlike bitmap fonts, which represent characters
							using a grid of pixels, vector fonts use mathematical equations to describe the contours and
							paths that make up each glyph. The most common vector font formats include TrueType (TTF)
							and PostScript Type 1.

						<ul>
							<li><b>Scalability:</b> Vector fonts can be resized without any loss of quality, ensuring
								sharp and clear characters at any size.</li>
							<li><b>Flexibility:</b> Can be easily transformed (rotated, skewed) while maintaining
								clarity.</li>
							<li><b>Print Quality:</b> Provides smoother edges, especially for large print sizes.</li>
							<li><b>File Size:</b> Generally, smaller file sizes than bitmap fonts for the same character
								sets.</li>

				<h3>Text Line Rendering</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							Rendering a line of text isn't as straightforward as merely displaying glyphs side by side.
							The process takes into account various factors such as kerning, baseline alignment, and text
							directionality. Properly rendered lines ensure text is readable, aesthetically pleasing, and
							maintains the intended meaning.

				<h3>Text Scrolling & Viewport</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							The viewport is the visible area of a text document or any other digital content. As
							documents exceed the size of the viewport, scrolling becomes necessary to navigate through
							the content. Effective text scrolling is crucial for user experience, allowing seamless
							exploration while keeping the content readable and well-rendered.

				<h3>The Magic of Anti-aliasing</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">

						<p>
							Anti-aliasing techniques smooth out jagged edges in rendered text by subtly coloring the
							pixels
							around the edges. This makes the text easier to read and more visually pleasing.
